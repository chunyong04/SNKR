SNKR Website
Beyond just e-commerce, SNKR App incorporates gamification elements to keep users engaged and rewarded.
A dynamic reward loop encourages users to interact with the app by browsing, purchasing, and engaging with community-driven features.
With a user-friendly front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and an immersive design crafted in Figma, SNKR App is a fusion of style, functionality, and interactive engagement—making it the go-to platform for sneakerheads.


Design Process
The SNKR App is designed for sneakerheads—passionate collectors and enthusiasts who seek the latest releases, exclusive drops, and authenticated sneaker resales.
Understanding this audience, my design process involved extensive research into leading sneaker websites such as Footlocker SG, SNKRDUNK, JD Sports, GOAT, StockX, and Nike Launch. 
By analyzing their UI/UX, layout structures, and user engagement strategies, I identified key features that enhance the shopping experience, such as high-quality visuals, intuitive navigation, and real-time product availability.

Sneakerheads value speed, authenticity, and a smooth browsing experience. To meet these needs, SNKR App features a bright, modern interface with seamless filtering options, clear categorization, and an engaging reward loop that encourages interaction. 
The design ensures that users can easily find their desired sneakers, stay updated on upcoming releases, and confidently make purchases. 
By combining industry best practices with a sleek, user-friendly aesthetic, SNKR App provides the ultimate platform for sneaker enthusiasts to shop, discover, and engage with the sneaker culture.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
